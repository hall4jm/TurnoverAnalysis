# Turnover Analysis
With a large corporation subject to high turnover, this project aims to reduce the relatively high turnover rate by:

* Identifying departments with abnormally high turnover rates.
* Investigating which variables are most likely to be responsible for turnover rates.
* Making recommendations on how to improve the turnover rate of the company.

The data comes from a competition hosted by DataCamp.com
